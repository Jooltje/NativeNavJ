# Memory

The Memory component is the **Blackboard** in the application's architecture. It is the central authority for shared state.

## State

**goal**: The high-level objectives (Goal).
**state**: The current physical state of the aircraft (State).
**target**: The intermediate control targets generated by the Computer (Target).
**navigator**: The current status of the control system (Navigator).
**assistant**: The current status of the assistant (Assistant).
**settings**: The current settings for the application (Settings).

## Behavior

* It serves as the Blackboard for all Knowledge Sources.
* It is accessible by all Knowledge Sources for reading and writing.
* When any value in the Memory changes, the change is logged at the **DEBUG** level.
* It provides atomic access to its components.

## Concurrency

The Memory is accessed by multiple threads (Knowledge Sources), so it must be thread-safe and provide atomic updates for each of its fields.
