# Memory

The Memory component is the **Blackboard** in the application's architecture. It is the central authority for shared state.

## State

### Goal

The high-level objectives (Altitude, Speed, Heading).

### State

The current physical state of the aircraft.

### Target

The intermediate control targets generated by the Computer.

### Navigator

The current status of the control system.

### Assistant

The current status of the assistant.

## Behavior

* It serves as the Blackboard for all Knowledge Sources.
* It is accessible by all Knowledge Sources for reading and writing.
* When any value in the Memory changes, the change is logged at the **DEBUG** level.
* It provides atomic access to its components.

## Concurrency

The Memory is accessed by multiple threads (Knowledge Sources), so it must be thread-safe and provide atomic updates for each of its fields.
