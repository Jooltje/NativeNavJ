# Memory

The Memory component serves as the **Blackboard** in the application's architecture. It is the central authority for shared state, accessible by all Knowledge Sources.

## Structure

### Goal

Contains the high-level objectives (Altitude, Speed, Heading) set by the user or the assistant.

### State

Contains the current physical state of the aircraft as reported by the sensors.

### Target

Contains the intermediate control targets (e.g., target pitch, target roll, target vertical speed) generated by the Computer for the Controllers to achieve.

### Navigator

The current status of the control system.

### Assistant

The current status of the assistant.

## Behavior

* When any value in the Memory changes, the change is logged at the **DEBUG** level.
* It providing atomic access to its components.

## Concurrency

The Memory is accessed by multiple threads (Knowledge Sources), so it must be thread-safe and provide atomic updates for each of its fields.

The following Knowledge Sources interact with Memory:
* **Sensor**: Updates the `State`.
* **Computer**: Reads `Goal` and `State`, updates `Target`.
* **Controllers**: Read `Target` and `State`.
* **Shell/Assistant**: Update `Goal`.
* **Orchestrator**: Initializes the `Memory` and orchestrates its lifecycle.
